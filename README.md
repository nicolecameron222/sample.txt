The sun shines brightly in the sky.
Fluffy clouds drift lazily by.
Birds chirp and trees sway,
On this beautiful sunny day.

The park is filled with laughter and glee,
As children run around, as free as can be.
Dogs bark, and kites soar high,
Underneath the vast blue sky.

By evening, the horizon turns gold,
Stories of the day, in whispers, are told.
The world calms as the sun does set,
And the scene is one, we'll never forget.
